# JoSAA DATA ANALYSIS PORTAL 
<br><br>

<section>
        <p>This project aims to create a portal to explore the seat allotment statistics of the Joint Seat 
Allocation Authority (JOSAA) until 2023. The portal allows users to analyse the data and provides 
insights and visualisations based on the JOSAA seat allotment data from 2016 to 2023. Below are 
the key objectives and technologies used in this project.</p>

         <h2>Data Extraction and Cleaning</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>The JOSAA seat allotment data has been provided and is ready for analysis. The data cleaning 
process involves using the NumPy and Pandas libraries to clean and transform the data as 
required for analysis.</li>
           
            
        </ul>
</section>
   
        <section>
        <h2>Data Insights and Analysis</h2>
        <p>The portal offers several sections for in-depth data analysis:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Round-wise Trends:</strong> Check the opening and closing ranks for all six rounds for a particular year.</li>
            <li><strong>Year-wise Trends:</strong> Examine the opening and closing ranks from 2016-2023 for a specific round.</li>
            <li><strong>Top 20 Courses:</strong> Discover the top 20 courses suitable for you based on your achieved rank.</li>
